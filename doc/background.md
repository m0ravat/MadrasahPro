Project Background
- 
This is a project designed towards creating a program that allows people
to enroll onto a mosque system, while giving functionality for teachers
and higher level faculty.

Motivation and Purpose
-
From my experience, when I looked at the websites for local mosques I realised
they are very primitive, but most importantly don't allow students to 
enroll online. I feel like this is a large issue with technology advancing, 
so in an attempt to showcase my java/data management skills in a productive manner
I decided to make a mosque administration program. 
I intend to create a basic yet simple to use program, which will provide 
functionality from the student level to the headteacher level while simulating 
the real experience of how a mosque is run. This will be done by introducing 
features such as timetables, attendance management and much more.
