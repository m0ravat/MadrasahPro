# Software methodology
The methodology I have chosen is the waterfall model to develop my 
project. Since I am working alone and my project is to test my Java/database skills without implementation of a UI it is unlikely I will be expanding 
my project scope at this stage. In addition, since my requirements have been well-defined this methodology fits well. 
## Design stage
Since I have already defined my requirements the next stage is design, which will include the database design and class diagram which outlines basic functionality in the program. 
## Development Stage
For development, I will go on to create the relevant classes necessary, in addition to the necessary queries. I will make sure 
to add unit tests to ensure the program runs smoothly, and implement a database to run said queries in real time. 
## Testing
To ensure the program runs as expected, I will add a bunch of test data into the database, and go into every possible function to ensure data is stored properly and the outputs generated are correct.
This is crucial to ensuring all requirements are met properly. 
## Deployment
My program will be regularly updated through GitHub, where the end user can download and run the program on their local machine. Instructions on how to initialize the database will also be released on the main README file to ensure user satisfaction. 
## Maintenance
I will continue to maintain the program by optimising code where necessary, as well as gaining input from an expert, so I can make sure I
have met my requirements. If I haven't, I will ship relevant updates through GitHub.
